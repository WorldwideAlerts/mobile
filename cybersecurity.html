                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Meta, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and owned Facebook, 
                        Instagram, WhatsApp, Giphy, and other internet platforms. The multibillion-dollar has 
                        recently been fined 276 million dollars regarding a data leak that exposed the private 
                        information of 533 million of its users. Hefty fines are nothing new for the company, 
                        as in the past 18 months; they have been fined for a combined total tailing up to one 
                        billion dollars. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="report">
                    <h1>Report</h1>
                    <p>	The leaked information included the full names, phone numbers, locations, and birth dates
                         of Facebook users in 2018-2019. A group of hackers obtained this information in April 
                         2021 and sold it to the dark web for profit. This private data can be used in online 
                         fraud, identity fraud, and other countless attacks. This instance went unreported until 
                         recently when Irish regulators fined Meta. The Data Protection Commission (DPC) - the 
                         Irish supervisory authority for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - was the 
                         group that filed the fine against Meta as it violated the GDPR law passed in 2018 
                         intended to protect European consumers' privacy better. This privacy legislation is 
                         enforced upon all companies across the web to protect users' personal data and 
                         information. It is an improved version of the Data Protection Directive (DPD) passed in 
                         1995 by the European Union as it slowly became outdated.

                    <h1>Future of Meta</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hacking is currently one of the most common crimes, and Meta is a platform that frequently
                         gets hacked. However, the lack of support for hacked users is lackadaisical and shows 
                         horrible customer service from this well-known company. Currently, there are believed to 
                         be around 40,000 employees working in the FaceBooks safety and security sector, but even
                          with their efforts, calls go unanswered, and victims of these hacking incidents never 
                          receive any valuable information on what they could do. <br> Meta security representatives 
                          spoke to the public and tried to defend themselves by stating, ‚ÄúOur focus has been to 
                          study malicious behaviors and add new layers of defense to our arsenal to ensure we 
                          prevent and address potential gaps from multiple angles. Our goal over time is to make 
                          these behaviors more costly and difficult to hide, and less effective. It is a 
                          significant, ongoing effort that spans teams, departments, and time zones across Meta.‚Äù
                        <br>The public remains outraged as this has been an ongoing statement for years, yet the 
                        platform has still been highly vulnerable to digital attacks. Back in 2018, 
                        Mark Zuckerberg responded to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, stating, ‚ÄúWe have 
                        a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't, then we don't deserve to serve 
                        you,‚Äù and it seems now that Meta truly doesn't deserve its hundreds of millions of users 
                        after countlessly putting them at risk. <br>We hope to see improvements from Meta's 
                        Safety Center in both defending against these attacks and responding to victims of these 
                        attacks.

                        <h1>Future of Cybersecurity</h1>
                        <p>
                            Cybersecurity fights off attacks from hackers, scammers, and other online criminals. 
                            Cyber attacks allow these criminals to steal valuable personal information and that 
                            data that could be used against you in various ways. As the world is becoming more 
                            and more dependent on technology, cybersecurity is exceptionally vital for public 
                            safety. As a result, most businesses typically allocate 10% of their yearly budget to 
                            supporting cybersecurity. <br>
                            As these attackers become more inventive every day, artificial intelligence and 
                            machine learning are essential to refining cybersecurity. Companies must devote more 
                            resources to cybersecurity departments to ensure a safer environment. Top-name 
                            companies such as Meta, Yahoo, eBay, and Equifax have all been subject to constant 
                            attacks, and it is only through innovations in cybersecurity that we, as a community, 
                            can combat cyberattacks.
